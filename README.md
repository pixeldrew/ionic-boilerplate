ionic-boilerplate
=================

This is a boilerplate project for using Ionic Framework/Angular/Lawnchair/SASS/RequireJS and i18n all from Bower 
All of the good stuff in your repo and nothing you don't need. There is a gulp build file created to do minification for release.

For v2, I am aiming to set up a spec runner and gulp test tasks for automated unit testing.
